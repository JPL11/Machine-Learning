ðŸ§  MRI Brain Tumor Detection with Physics-Informed Denoising and YOLOv12

This repository presents a novel brain tumor detection pipeline that integrates a physics-informed denoising module with the cutting-edge YOLOv12 object detection framework. The proposed approach significantly enhances tumor detection performance, particularly under challenging noise conditions, by incorporating MRI acquisition physics, adaptive noise estimation, and task-specific contrast enhancement directly into the pipeline.
